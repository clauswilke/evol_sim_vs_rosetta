        This is a script that calculates all of the amino acid count data for the natural yeast proteins.
    generate_graph_data.py
        This is a script that calculates all of the entropy, KL-Divergence, Entropy-Entropy, Entropy-RSA, Entropy-iCN and Entropy-iWCN correlation analysis
	

graphing/

    analysis_functions.py
        This a helper file that contains a series of functions used in the analysis				
    get_mean_effective_num_plot.py
        This script is the script that is used to create Figure 1.
    get_cor_combo.py
        This script is the script that is used to create Figures 2, and S1.
    get_cor_entropy_RSA_comb.py

    get_entropy_vs_entropy_38.py
        This script is the script that is used to create Figure S3.
    
t_test/
    Contains all of the R scripts used in the analysis

    t_test.R 
        This is a script that performs the statistics in the manuscript. 

methods_scripts/
    Contains the two shell scripts that were used to run minimization, RosettaDesign and evolutionary simulation

    score_mutant_AIT_v1_1.py
        This is a script that was used to minimize native structures
        For arguments you must give it the PDB name.
    design_protein_fixed.sh
        This the shell script that was used to create the fixed backbone protein design
        For arguments you must give it the PDB name and the temperature used for Backrub.
        Since it is a fixed design we just set the temperature to 0.0 purely for identification purposes.
    score_mutant_AIT_v1_1.py
        This is a script that was used to minimize native structures
        For arguments you must give it the PDB name and score extracted from structures generated by score_mutant_AIT_v1_1.py.

sequences/
    Contains all of the sequences (both designed and natural) for the project
    
    aligned_sequences/
        These are the natural alignments
    designed_sequences/
        These are the designed sequences extracted from the yeast-protein designed proteins 	

structures/
    This contains the PDB Files that were used as templates in the yeast-proteins design process
